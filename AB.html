    <h1>American Bullfrog</h1>
    <h2>Scentific name: Lithobates Catesbeianus</h2>
    <h3>Named in honor of English naturalist Mark Catesby</h3>

    <p>They are olive green on top with the color lightening on the underside.
        Only the males have yellow throats. Breeding season lasts two to three
        months from May or early June into July. Native to North America with 
        a range from the Atlantic Coast to Newfoundland and as far west and 
        Oklahoma. They become an invasive species in many places due to them 
        being big enough to be edible for humans. In the same manner, they will
        eat anything they can shove down their throats from rodents to crustaceans.
