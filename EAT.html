    <h1>Eastern American Toad</h1>
    <h2>Scientific name: Anaxyrus Americanus</h2>

       <p>Eastern American Toads are short and stout with a circular snout.
        They are covered in warts and look purpetually grumpy.
        You can tell the males and females apart by slight coloration differences but both can have a spotted pattern.
        They can be found from Ontario to Minnesota and the East Coast to Missouri. 
        They often stay within an area of 100' x 100' unless it is mating season, which is from April to July.</p>
