    <h1>Eastern Spadefoot</h1>
    <h2>Scientific name: Scaphiopus Holbrookii</h2>

    <p>Brownish in color with two yellow stripes begining at the eyes and 
        going down the back. They spend most of their life burrowed deep 
        underground in hibernation. The only times they emerge is to eat 
        or breed. Studies have found that they are more likely to come out 
        at night when it is warmer and more humid. They mostly eat small
        invertebrates such as termites, insects, arachnids, and worms.
        They are found along the Atlantic coast, through the Mid-Atlantic 
        staes and into southern New England.
