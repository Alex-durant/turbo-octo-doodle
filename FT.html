    <h1>Fowler's Toad</h1>
    <h2>Scientific name: Anaxyrus Fowleri</h2>
    <h3>This toad was named after Samuel Page Fowler who was the founder of the Essex County Natural History Society.</h3>

        <p>The most common colors they can be are grey, brown, olive green, and rust red.
            The belly is white with one dark spot and the males are usually darker in color than females.
            They can be found in almost any wetlands and forests throughout eastern United States and southeastern Canada.
            Mating season extends through all of the spring but most frequently in May and June.
            This is the toad that sits in ponds and croaks loudly all day to attract a mate!
            They have also been known to play dead in the face of predators such as snakes, birds, and small mammals.
        </p>
