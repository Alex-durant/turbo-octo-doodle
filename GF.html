    <h1>Green Frog</h1>
    <h2>Scientific name: Lithobathes Clamitans or Rana Clamitans</h2>

    <p>They are named for having varying shades of green on at least their
        heads. If they are not fully green the rest of their bodies can 
        be brown, gray, or blue. They change to a darker shade on cold days
        to absorb more heat. This type of frog lives mainly in and around
        water sources. They are widespread across North America from the 
        St. Lawrence River Valley in Canada to Northern Florida and Eastern
        Texas. The breeding season ocurrs throughout all of spring and summer.
        They hunt by sitting still and waiting for any small creature
        they can fit in their mouths to pass by.
